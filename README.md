The project has 4 classes, from which one is the main. The other 3 are for users, questions and quizzes. All 3 are lists, for better and easier use in the program.
The data is stored in .csv files for easier use. 
The program starts by reading the files user.csv, question.csv, quizz.csv for creating the lists with already existing objects.
Then we start processing the agrs. The comments from code explains what every part does.
